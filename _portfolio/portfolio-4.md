Project Description
------
In a six-member team, we built a model vehicle with regenerative braking for better energy efficiency. The regenerative braking is achieved with a flywheel system and an automatic engaging/disengaging method to convert kinetic energy between a vehicle and a flywheel. When the vehicle transits down from a ramp, the gear system is initially engaged and the potential energy (from height) of the vehicle will be transferred and stored in the flywheel. When using the stored energy to accelerate the vehicle, the gear system will first disengage, and the belt system will then engage to consume the stored energy. 

My Main Contributions
------                              
-	Proposed and validate the final selected disengaging mechanism.                                                                         
-	Conducted simulations in MATLAB to optimize the system for better energy recovery and braking performance.                               
-	Fabricated and tested a vehicle model with the regenerative braking system.
