Project Description
------
The Goal of this project is to build a remote-controlled fireboat that delivers water to targets. The water is delivered by a pressurized 2L beverage bottle (*missing in the figures), partially filled with water, carried by the boat. My key contributions in this five people team are optimizing the pressure system to deliver as much water as possible, leading the team to meet milestones, and collaborating with other sub-teams to develop MATLAB simulations for performance prediction.

My Main Contributions
------                   
•	Built a simulation model in MATLAB to optimize its propulsion system in terms of efficiency and speed.                                   
•	Built a fluid dynamics model for its pressure system to pump water from a container and calculated the optimum air-water ratio to maximize water discharge.                                                                                                                 
•	Calculated the dimension of the boat hull to ensure enough buoyancy force and structure strength using formulas from external research.   
•	Tested the prototype in a pool and predicted the boat speed with a 94% accuracy in the final competition.
