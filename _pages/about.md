I am currently a MEng student in Mechanical Engineering from [UC Berkeley] (https://www.berkeley.edu/). I hold a B.A.S. in Mechanical Engineering from [The University of British Columbia] (https://www.ubc.ca/). During my undergraduate study, I designed, prototyped, and tested the drivetrain of a regenerative braking vehicle, the pressure system of a remote-controlled fireboat, and a mandible cutting guide. Also, I used simulation to enhance the performance of those projects. My pervious work experience includes managing draws and documents in [The Robbins Company] (https://www.therobbinscompany.com/), developing manufacturing tools for brain stent in AccuMedical, and designing a blood separation device and a magnetic shielding containment in [STEMCELL Technologies] (https://www.stemcell.com/). Currently, I am working on my Capstone project, which is a MEMS device for the electroporation of cells.
